# Matrix Tokenizer Sorting Assignment
## Project: Working with 2-dimensional arrays, a string tokenizer, insertion sort, and selection sort

## Project Overview
The main objecives include:
* set up a 2D array (or matrix) with proper initial values using vector of vectors
* given a string, implement a tokenizer to identify all the unique tokens contained within this string and the number of times (i.e., frequency) a given token appears in this string.
* create a new datatype using struct to hold a token and its frequency; further store all the tokens and their frequencies into a vector
* implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort the list of tokens in increasing order of frequency
* implement the selection sort algorithm to sort the list of tokens in decreasing order of frequency
* overloading the <= , + and << operators
